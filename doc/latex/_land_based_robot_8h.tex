This C++ program is a header file for the Land\+Based\+Robot. This is an abstract base class from which we will inherit all the functions of base class like simple Go\+Up and Go\+Down and besides we also have access of attributes like speed and width as well.\hypertarget{_m_a_z_e_8h_DESCRIPTION}{}\subsection{D\+E\+S\+C\+R\+I\+P\+T\+I\+ON}\label{_m_a_z_e_8h_DESCRIPTION}
This class declaration for files which are in \hyperlink{_land_based_robot_8cpp}{Land\+Based\+Robot.\+cpp} this all function will be used to move robot.

A base class from which we inherit properties of Land\+Based\+Robots.
