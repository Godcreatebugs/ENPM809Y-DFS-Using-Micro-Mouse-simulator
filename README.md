# ENPM809Y-DFS-Using-Micro-Mouse-simulator
**This is the final project for ENPM809Y where group has implemented _DFS algorithm_ on robot to find goal in the maze.**

This is a team project to implement the DFS algorithm for nodes expansion in the maze. Basically we find best possoble way to get to the goal after each state. 
**The output is carried out using Micro-mouse simulator and only available for ubuntu to verify results.
